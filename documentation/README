[apci1710-asyn/documentation/README]


Overview

    This is an EPICS asyn port driver for the ADDI-DATA APCIe-1711 PCI-Express incremental counter board.
    The driver supports reading counters by both polling and interrupt modes.
    Interrupt mode support includes EVR timestamps.
    Reading of both raw counts and engineering units is supported.

    Source for an example ioc application is provided.  To build it, uncomment PROD_IOC in apci1710App/src/Makefile.
    It will be necessary to uncomment additional dependencies in makefiles and configure/RELEASE.

    See ADDI-DATA's website for hardware info:

Record Descriptions

    Record Name             Description
    -----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    $(P)$(R)Counts          Read the raw counter value; polled at 10 Hz.
    $(P)$(R)RTCounts        Read the real-time raw counter value; interrupt mode with EVR timestamps support.
    $(P)$(R)POSN            Read the engineering unit value; polled at 10 Hz.
    $(P)$(R)RTPOSN          Read the real-time engineering unit value; interrupt mode with EVR timestamps support.
    $(P)$(R)Reset           Zero the counter by writing 1 to this binary output.


Database Template Macro Requirements

    Macro Name              Description
    -----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    $(P) and $(R)           These macros are concatenated to form the PV prefix.
    $(PORT)                 Must match the asyn port.
    $(ADDR)                 Channel index: 0, 1, 2, 3
    $(ESLO)                 Linear conversion factor (ai record, LINR=SLOPE).  Must be non-0.
    $(EGU)                  Human readable engineering unit description, up to 16 chars.


Kernel Module Requirements

    Two kernel modules are required.

    Name            Origin      Path
    ---------------+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    apci1710.ko     ADDI-DATA  /afs/slac/g/lcls/package/linuxKernel_Modules/apci1710drv/r1439/buildroot-2015.02-x86_64
    apci1710ctr.ko  SLAC       /afs/slac/g/lcls/package/linuxKernel_Modules/apci1710ctr/r1439_1_0/buildroot-2015.02-x86_64

    Module apci1710 is used by module apci1710ctr. Thus one must insert module apci1710.ko into the Linux kernel
    before apci1710ctr.ko.


Debugging Tips

    Using the apci1710ctr module's /proc interface, it is simple to verify basic counter operation from the shell.
    For example, to read the first counter:

      # cat /proc/driver/apci1710ctr0/counter 
      52232462
      # cat /proc/driver/apci1710ctr0/counter 
      52352236
      #

    If /proc/driver/apci1710ctr0 is missing then the kernel modules have not been inserted successfully.

    Test the $(P)$(R)Counts record first.  It is a longin record, and it reports raw counts.
    Test the $(P)$(R)POSN record next.  It is an ai record with LINR=SLOPE; the ESLO macro must be non-0.
    Test the $(P)$(R)RTCounts $(P)$(R)RTPOSN records last.  They require external interrupts to function.


Known Issues

    Support is currently limited to a single board with 4 counter channels.
